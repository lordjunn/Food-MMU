       Well, I survived the gullotine of education, and was rewarded for my efforts.
       No outings or anything this month, the outside world does not need me.
       Though skills wise, I did improve quite a bit thanks to Uni societies.

       3 more months, before society barges into my life. Not even the cage can save me.

        New things were done, new people were met, and a face I'd long wanted to see finally appeared.
        This month was packed, emotionally and physically ‚Äî hit my PR at steps for one, and emptied myself thanks to a hangout.
        Choices danced between routine comfort and curiosity-led detours ‚Äî staying in the comforts of my circle, or venturing out into the unknown.
        And all this, barely halfway into the trimester.

        Clubs site, Codenection, academic chaos, internship hunting ‚Äî everything""s converging. Tasks keep stacking, and I‚Äôm still expected to triump it all.
        So be it. Let's see what my limits are.

        Life's uncertain, a rat-race of pain ‚Äî the weight just keeps stacking up high.
        Game Jam wrapped and successful, but Hack Day looms. Club site lingers on top of me still, deadlines multiply, and the internship clock ticks louder with every passing second.
        Several j*b applications, just a few interviews, and radio silence in the end.
        Some days I ate alone, some days surrounded ‚Äî sometimes NPC mode, sometimes present. I'm still figuring out which one I prefer.
        Everything's moving fast. I missed meetings, went into places I don't belong in, and TCD got cancelled. Small wins ‚Äî like finally getting my upgrades ‚Äî felt like minor triumphs, despite the impact it bought to my spendings. This is the highest it's ever been.

        It's all chaos. But I'm still standing. Somehow. All I got is to keep on praying.

        Projects done, Assignments done, Internship secured, Tests done, with 2 more presentations left.
        With all that settled, a bit of fun is of necessity. Which I did with the second iteration of CM 2025.

        Places went, connections made. Memories made, with some worthy images.
        End of an era, as the trimester break starts, signalising my internship is starting in under a month.

        One month to revitalise myself with human communication skills, before I let everyone down.

        Make this the ""wake up call"" for me to focus hard to get a cushy job.
        I now understand why people work at lower end jobs despite having higher end qualifications.

       That was, to say the least, an eye opener to how the real world works.

       Traffic jams, deadlines, things that do not work, unresponsive help channels, unrelated tasks, unreasonable expectations. 
       Also Saturday work, despite it being half day, it still sucks.
       Two more months, but after that it is back to the depths of University, with Final Year Project creeping into me.

       Just end me already.
