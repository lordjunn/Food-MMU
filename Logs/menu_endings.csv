       No outings or anything this month, the outside world does not need me.

        New things were done, new people were met, and a face I'd long wanted to see finally appeared.
        This month was packed, emotionally and physically — hit my PR at steps for one, and emptied myself thanks to a hangout.
        Choices danced between routine comfort and curiosity-led detours — staying in the comforts of my circle, or venturing out into the unknown.
        And all this, barely halfway into the trimester.

        Clubs site, Codenection, academic chaos, internship hunting — everything""s converging. Tasks keep stacking, and I’m still expected to triump it all.

        Life's uncertain, a rat-race of pain — the weight just keeps stacking up high.
        Game Jam wrapped and successful, but Hack Day looms. Club site lingers on top of me still, deadlines multiply, and the internship clock ticks louder with every passing second.
        Several j*b applications, just a few interviews, and radio silence in the end.
        Some days I ate alone, some days surrounded — sometimes NPC mode, sometimes present. I'm still figuring out which one I prefer.
        Everything's moving fast. I missed meetings, went into places I don't belong in, and TCD got cancelled. Small wins — like finally getting my upgrades — felt like minor triumphs, despite the impact it bought to my spendings. This is the highest it's ever been.

        It's all chaos. But I'm still standing. Somehow. All I got is to keep on praying.

        Places went, connections made. Memories made, with some worthy images.
        End of an era, as the trimester break starts, signalising my internship is starting in under a month.

        One month to revitalise myself with human communication skills, before I let everyone down.

        Quite some breaks, which thankfully eased my wallet a litte, though got hit with a slightly hard dent at 14, which kinda NULL-ed what I saved.
        Some tasks done, with more to be done, and even more to be received. My head bangs through the walls, like Satori with my bottle.

        Well, here comes the final stretch, the final push that see if all I've done is worth it, or it was for nothing.

       From the frying pan of the internship into the fire of the new trimester.
       How I so much miss the ""freedom"" of student life (that comes with overall higher spendings in return).

       Landlord didn't come in the end, but did gave funds for a new wardrobe (the old one is still growing its empire).
       Codenection was to say the least, I didn't do too much in the grand scheme of things, and an infinite glitch of Nasi Lemak.
       Free food is the best food, even if it's the same (cold?) meal three times in a row.
       
       Culinary wise, it was mostly consistent, with new foods from time to time.
       The Prosperity Burger has returned, a greasy reminder that the year is ending.
       
       FYP looms, randoms in my group assignments, the fungal infection in my room may have stopped for now, but it will always return.
       One month left to salvage 2025. Let's prepare for 2026.

December 2025,"The Penultimate Year, ends.",RM 712.80,"Afterthoughts, Jan 1:
        December didn't arrive to be kind — it arrived to be endured, a closing chapter (for the year) that refused to slow down.

        Meals became markers of time rather than rest: eaten between deadlines, long walks, and late nights of code.
        Some were comforting, most were functional — fuel to keep moving when stopping wasn't an option.
        Inflation crept in quietly; stalls slipped in quality, portions fluctuated, and even food felt like it demanded negotiation.

        FYP pressure never truly left, even during supposed breaks.
        Across all subjects, new requirements kept stacking, leaving little room to breathe.
        Random groupmates performed decent enough to keep panic at bay — a small mercy in my opinion, thanks past me for choosing the right ones.
        Outside of work, things with my mates felt a little turbulent lately — subtle shifts in tone, distance I couldn't fully place.
        Still, I managed to meet some people during the picture day, despite the blazing weather and 19,619 steps. It was nice.
        Retired at the IT Society also, but still part of the GDC. Pressure builds as the chance to be director for some events presents itself to me.

        Yet, despite all the strain — nothing collapsed. At least, not me... yet.

        This month wasn't about enjoyment or balance — it was about not falling apart while everything pressed in at once.
        2025 ends not with relief, but with momentum. Momentum to keep going.
        I'm tired — uncertain about what lies ahead — but still standing.
        And that, somehow, is enough. For future me.
