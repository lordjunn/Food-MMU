Chili - very spicy, not recomended for me to take.
Curry - pretty nice to eat with
Spice Fried Chicken - it's ok, better than regular fried chicken below.
Fried Chicken - better to choose the spice version, or is it because of different parts?
Steamed Rice - had better rice downstairs. Still edible, but quantity is a little low?
4 slices of cucumber

                    It tastes good for an egg fried rice though, no meat, just egg, onions, green onions.

                    As for free flow drinks that costs 1.00 (fried rice itself is 9.00):
                    
Chinese Tea - normal taste, ok
Sunquick - does not taste like the average orange juice found in either Salam or Hotels
Bandung - more like rose, not as sweet vs Salam
? drink - sweet, quite sweet, but drinkable. Unsure if it's Lime Tea or Syrup","2025/May/2025, May, image 18.png"

...No meat?

                Okay, now this is getting... out of hand. 黑店. No meat and it dares charge way more than dapo? Even the one at Double D is more worth as it has an egg.
                Though maybe, just maybe, I could try the nasi lemak as your final grace. 2.50 for 1 pack, so maybe 2 packs should fill me?","2025/September/2025, September, image 11.png"
22 Sep 2025 (Monday),Char Kuey Teow + Noodles (B),Double D Restaurant,RM 10.00,(Lunch),"I don't want to commit fully to a different type of noodle, so let's try this hybrid for now.
                
2 prawns & fishcake
6 cockles
Tauge, Egg, Chives

                Compared to the previous one, it lacks 1 slice of chinese sausage?","2025/September/2025, September, image 12.png"
23 Sep 2025 (Tuesday),Roasted Chicken Thigh Rice,Ramai Food Centre,RM 8.00,(Lunch),"Kidnapped by the permas again, don't have to fuss over lunch.
                I tried the CKT before, let's try the chicken rice.
                It isn't as good compared to Double D.
                
Bones: everywhere
Chili: sour
Soup: fine

                I should try soup based meals.","2025/September/2025, September, image 13.png"
24 Sep 2025 (Wednesday),Mixed Rice,Double D Restaurant,RM 10.00,(Lunch),"The Sarawak noodle shop is closed, oh well, back to you then.
                
9 pieces of fried pork, with 1 that's kinda a combined one
1 tongful of fresh vege (just came out when I arrived), with an additional forkful as belanja'ed by Aunty
Wild boar curry (just the curry)
Regular rice, no add on

                Aunty rizz, somehow the reviews aren't that kind to her though. Then again her prices can't compare with M.H.M.R
                Trying the not so high review mixed rice restaurant at the far corner next?","2025/September/2025, September, image 14.png"
25 Sep 2025 (Thursday),Set C,BP72 Mixed Rice,RM 9.50,(Lunch),"Double D is closed, so why not here, might as well see if it lives up to it's reputation (of low star rating).
                Ordered Set C, as it was looking promising (priced less than 3 sisters). They helped serve me instead of me self service.
                
Rice: 1 full scoop
Fried Chicken: can choose between thigh or drumstick, typical chain mixed rice taste
Mixed curry: is nice, in a bowl so won't pre-mix with rice
Cabbage: nice as well, similar to HSHs one?
Sambal thingy: melayu style, not really my taste, anchovies are air-ed

                Huh, not that bad overall. Then again no one really rated here for their set meals, only actual mixed rice.
                Let's try the actual mixed rice next month then, to prevent dent in my sub 10.00.","2025/September/2025, September, image 15.png"
26 Sep 2025 (Friday),Dry Mee Poh (B),Double D Restaurant,RM 10.00,(Lunch),"It's open. I wanted to try their Dry Kweh Tiaw, but he don't have it.
                This noodle is kinda sticking to each other. And the meat/etc is the same like other noodles.

                I'd like to try the Dry Wantan Noodles, but that costs 11.","2025/September/2025, September, image 16.png"
29 Sep 2025 (Monday),Chicken Rice,Double D Restaurant Puchong,RM 8.00,(Lunch),"So engrossed in my work I forgot lunch hour came. Decided to have chicken rice to taste compare with Ramais.
                I stand corrected, here is indeed better than there.
                
Bones: at least it's in 1 piece, also has suckable deliciousness
Chili: spicy more than sour
Soup: yummers

                Then again, I'm comparing breast with thigh.","2025/September/2025, September, image 17.png"
30 Sep 2025 (Tuesday),Fried Kuay Teow,Double D Restaurant,RM 9.00,(Lunch),"Been a while since I tried this stall.
                Spicy at first bite, but somehow back to normal thereafterwards, and a little wet.
                
Cabbage, carrot strips, diced vege
Chicken meat pieces, egg
2 prawns
Unsure how the chili pairs here, but it's fine. Same for lime","2025/September/2025, September, image 18.png"
01 Oct 2025 (Wednesday),Bangkok Fried Rice,Double D Restaurant,RM 10.00,(Lunch),"Their serving time is definitely ""a while"" compared to Kolo or Chicken Rice, maybe like 15 minutes or so. Best not to choose when hungry.
                It seems like an egg fried rice, with an attempt of a non paprick paprick chicken pieces at the side.
                
Fried rice: egg, onion, long beans?, carrot strips
Chicken: chicken pieces, onions. Enough to last if paired well enough
4 halves of sliced cucumbers (or 2 full slices in a sense)

                Flavourful, I'd give it that.",No image
