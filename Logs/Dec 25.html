    The year's final month arrives like a weight I can't set down.<br>
    FYP deadlines loom like shadows, new subjects press against the walls of my attention, and the chaos refuses to pause with random groupmates.<br>
    Each day folds into the next, a tangle of code, readings, and chores, and I chase it all knowing that missing a single beat could ripple across everything, akin the Butterfly Effect.<br><br>

    The apartment smells faintly of Ikea and fungus, reminders that life continues while I sprint through a maze of tasks.<br>
    Nights stretch long and thin; sleep is a currency I spend reluctantly, only to find the next day demanding repayment with interest, or face shutting down.<br>
    Yet somehow, amid the fatigue, there's a quiet pulse of accomplishment — small victories stacked against a backdrop of relentless work.<br><br>

    This month is not about ease. It's about endurance, about finishing the year not in comfort but in motion.<br>
    If 2025 (and Presoft) taught me anything, it's that growth isn't measured in peace, but in persistence.<br>
    So I push forward, one task, one deadline, one exhausted breath at a time. Using up all the skills learnt thus far.<br>
    The end is near, but I'm still standing — still learning, still adapting, still becoming.

                Peeked into how they serve rice, it seemed to be 1 nice bowlful, then add on half a bowl.<br>

                They're eating Wednesday rice (fitting). I wanted to eat what I wanted yesterday.
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheese sauce: it's nice but a bit lacking further into the meal</li>
                    <li>Some tomato in it, also lettuce</li>
                    <li>It's 8 cuts, each cut is more or less 2 finger joints</li>
                    <li>Spicy sauce has a delayed kick, needs to hit throat for the kick; Garlic sauce is not as stonks</li>
                    <li>Limau ais: the ice they gave filled my cup, I finished my drink before the food</li>
                </ul>                
                Big is quite filling I would say, but small is good for a light meal.
