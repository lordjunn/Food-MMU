                The rice is a little dry, but quite alot of chicken (at least 10) & they're decently sized.<br>

                I'd take Dapur, but that's easily +30% price wise, also no drinks.<br>
                It seems that I could ask for more rice, I just need to voice out.

                A fine & flavourful fried rice, though some parts may be more flavourful than others, which means slightly not even.

                My indesiciveness sent me here, otherwise I'd be eating something cheaper (as they have yet to come down).<br>
                Been a while since I had these style of ordering.
                <ul>
                    <li>Kangkung Biasa: quite fine - 6.00</li>
                    <li>Tomyam Campur: typical tomyam taste, has chicken & seafood - 11.00</li>
                    <li>Daging Kunyit: meat is nice - 8.50</li>
                    <li>Telur Dadar: quite fine - 2.00/ea</li>
                    <li>Nasi Putih - 2.00/ea</li>
                </ul>
                So to breakdown what I actually ate:
                <ul>
                    <li>4 tumeric beef</li>
                    <li>3 prawns, 2 sotong rings, 2 chicken pieces from tomyam; also drank like 1/3 the tomyam while waiting for their satay via spoon</li>
                    <li>I think a scoopful of kangkung</li>
                    <li>3 cucumber pieces (from their satay, I didn't order)</li>
                </ul>                
                I'd take the whole bowl & chug it down if I was more extroverted/bold & daring. I'm not sure if I'm black hole mode, or food portions are actually kinda small.<br>
                <small>*Koyori said the prawn sucks, but to me it feels like a typical melayu prawn (from Nasi Goreng Seafood)</small>

                After a botched non-existent dry run for Codenection 2025, and an offer to return before 9pm, I return to the classics.<br>
                They did take a while, assuming their roti chef wasn't here yet.<br>
                Tastes the same as always, with the dhal being a little too beany, and the sambal having a slight hint of ginger.<br><br>

                I should ask if adding more sauces was an option, along with trying out an option called calling satay to pair with white rice.<br>
                My calculations say it would cost around 6.5 to 8 (assuming 3-4 sticks of chicken).

                Went at 11:50am, said prep at 12, waited until 12:22pm where they asked for my order again, came at 12:28pm.
                <ul>
                    <li>Soup: like the bakso I had here, unlike Skys</li>
                    <li>Sambal: it's servicable with rice, didn't manage to add it</li>
                    <li>Chicken: it's a wing, and it is fine</li>
                    <li>Rice: added once, felt I could gamble a 2.5. It gave me a 3rd instead, kinda struggled but triumped in the end.</li>
                    <li>Crispy thing: better than membawangs one, though be careful of small bones</li>
                    <li>Tofu: unlike membawangs, but still ok</li>
                    <li>Tempe: sucks</li>
                    <li>2 cucumber slices, 2 raw cabbage slices, 1 lettuce leaf</li>

                3 bowls of rice was not fun. Still feeling not hungry despite being dinner time, took a small walk even.<br>
                Asked Gemini to choose my meal, and it insists I take a Shawarma, depsite being the more expensive option (was thinking of Sky prices). Went here instead as I remember it also serves it.<br>
                Didn't know they gave free drinks, which is a bigger plus, on top of being cheaper than sky. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheese sauce: tastes like typical cheese sauce</li>
                    <li>Some tomato in it, also lettuce</li>
                    <li>It's 5 cuts, each cut is around 1.5 phalanx long</li>

                On the kinda advice from Gemini, decided to take a lighter approach for lunch, even though that may mean hunger.
                <ul>

                    <li>1 scoop & a little more for kangkung goreng</li>
                    <li>Rice: just 2 scoops & a little small ball, aka less than usual</li>
                    <li>Dark sauce: presumed black pepper, from black pepper chicken. Kinda spicy.</li>
                    <li>Little blob of sauce: seems like bakso style soup, from soupy chicken.</li>

                My bois seem to want to eat this, it is the same stall as I went months ago.<br>
                Has it improved? It listened to my asing, so that's good.<br>
                Price is the same, with 5 base, and 4 for the spiced fried chicken, thigh.
                <ul>
                    <li>Brown sauce: weird</li>
                    <li>Beansprouts: might be raw, a bit not that great vs Ipoh Taugehs</li>
                    <li>The curry, chili, and brown things are the same</li>
                    <li>Fish crackers: a litte stale, but otherwise seems ok</li>
                    <li>Blue rice: could be better, some parts are slightly on harder end, not cake though</li>
                    <li>Everything else is commendable as the previous entry, and I used the lime to make lime water.</li>

                There was a slight debate in me whether to eat Kahwin, or this. This restaurant is rarer for me to eat for dinner.<br>
                I assume the rotis are for breakfast, so let's have this one.

                Tomorrow seems to be McD. So they decided to go for cheaper meals (Hinz is noted to be expensive, and Benon doesn't like RYM.)<br>
                Debating between Roti John (long bread) and rice, I chose the safer (cheaper) option.
                <ul>
                    <li>My thai seems ok with 3 prawns (like any other Malay type prawn), that vege, onions, and chicken (same type as biasa).</li>
                    <li>Nasi Goreng Belacan is said to be salty, and lacks belacan taste?</li>
                    <li>Kuey Teow Goreng looks typical malay style, wet, not dry.</li>
                </ul>
                Noted the 2 other based on what I've observed from others. Oh yeah, no extra food today.

                I didn't want to have bawang again, and I've had other stalls before. Herrscher told me there's a chicken rice stall, so let's go for it.
                <ul>
                    <li>Teh o ais seems fine, it was initially brewed to be half cup</li>
                    <li>Received a wing, it's fine. Chicken meat has a slight charred taste.</li>
                    <li>Rice is kinda nice, though finished it within half a wing.</li>
                    <li>Soup ok, dark sauce is slightly burnt?, chili is normal, an aquired taste though so may take some time to get used to it.</li>
                    <li>1 lettuce leaf, 2 cucumber slices</li>
                </ul>
                Conclusion: bawang is more worth in general, though this is fine if you want to eat less.<br>
                Adding rice which could make it more filling puts it in the same tier as bawang, which is ehhh 50 50. Free drink though.
